## Completion Status

:::info
This documentation is a work in progress! If you have any questions, or if you think you've found an issue, please [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/poiyomi) and ask! Our goal is to have a fully-fleshed out documentation site with rich visual examples and explanations for all of the shader features.

During the creation of this documentation, however, priority is placed on getting text-based documentation complete first, followed by images and videos, so don't panic if it seems like there's a lot of text for now!
